# A little guide for thr template

Just a some assistance to what I understood about some parts.

## Layout

I've added this component that contains: Header, Leftnavbar & the right chat.

### Contacts

Apparently it's the "Confirm Friend" that can be found on home.

### className="right-chat-active"

Removing it makes the design wider. Apparently, it indicates that the right chat menu is active which makes the body goes inside to make space.
